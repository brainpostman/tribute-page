            <p>Initially working for UNATCO in 2052, JC's main job is to combat and
                stop terrorist organizations such as the NSF. He and his brother,
                <a href="https://deusex.fandom.com/wiki/Paul_Denton" target="_blank">Paul Denton</a>,
                start off as UNATCO agents having been nano-augmented and developed
                at Area 51. JC then switches allegiance to the NSF, stops Bob Page's
                (a maniacal multi-billionaire) conspiracy and saves the world from
                his terror.</p>
            <p>J.C. Denton is a codename. He is revealed to be sharp, intelligent and
                perceptive, yet cold, stoic and a bit of a loner. This is in contrast
                to his brother, who is passionate and empathetic. However, JC is also
                highly idealistic and believes his work in UNATCO to be heroic and
                for the greater good. One of the childhood heroes
                of J.C. Denton is <a target="_blank" href="https://deusex.fandom.com/wiki/Sam_Carter">Sam Carter</a>,
                whom JC read about in school.</p>

        <div id="biography" class="biography"><p class="bold">Timeline of JC Denton's upbringing and early life:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">2029</span> - JC Denton was born on March 17, a clone of Paul Denton created in a
                    secret project of the MJ12 organization (an offshoot of the Illuminati), led by Bob Page.
                    Paul's real mother acted as the surrogate for the cloned embryo.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2035</span> - displeased with Paul's progress in their project of creating the
                    perfect nano-augmented agent, MJ12 decided to create a backup plan in JC. JC's parents
                    were assassinated and JC was sent to Majestic 12's Swiss school, where he spent the next 12
                    years of his life. During this time, Majestic 12 attempted to instill in JC an
                    unquestioning loyalty to superiors and a willingness to obey orders. Nonetheless,
                    JC still developed a hidden rebellious attitude.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2047</span> - JC graduates from the Swiss school, with noted excellence in
                    marksmanship and swimming.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2052</span> - JC was nano-augmented and became a UNATCO agent.
                    His cloning and augmentations cost around 50 billion dollars.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bold">Birth of a Legend</p>
            <p>In 2052, JC is a new anti-terrorist agent working for the United Nations Anti-Terrorist
                Coalition, based on Liberty Island. His first mission is to investigate an NSF terrorist
                attack on the island itself, and find the leader in the Statue of Liberty. After this he
                is sent to follow the terrorists' trail to recover stolen Ambrosia, a cure for the Gray
                Death virus that is plaguing the planet. Once he has found the final stolen barrel of
                Ambrosia, he is given the choice of killing the terrorist leader, Juan Lebedev, allowing
                his partner Anna Navarre to kill Lebedev, or to kill agent Navarre. Regardless of his
                decision, he returns to UNATCO headquarters and is sent on a mission to Hong Kong.
                Before leaving, he rebels against UNATCO and is captured and imprisoned in an MJ12 base
                beneath UNATCO headquarters. He escapes to Hong Kong to meet Tracer Tong, who, he is
                told, can deactivate his killswitch. After uncovering a conspiracy in Hong Kong
                and uniting the warring Triads, JC goes to a naval shipyard to investigate ties
                the Illuminati may have to the global conspiracy. Stanton Dowd, owner of the ship
                and high-ranking Illuminatus, sends JC to Paris to meet the leader of the Illuminati,
                Morgan Everett. Everett sends JC to Vandenberg, where he meets and helps a group
                of scientists called X-51 who are trying to make their own cure for the virus.
                JC finally goes to Area 51, merges with Helios, an artificial intelligence,
                and becomes the savior of the world.
